Seems crazy, how is it a movement, when i am the only person in it?<br>Good question. But, to get to that, i would need to tell you a deep story about a quiet programmar. Programmars are of varied kinds as well. As, some of them program to build cool stuff and show it to the whole world. While, some just wants to live in their imagination. That’s just so much, more prettier.</p>
<p>I was the second kind. Never liked to go outside and play with my fellow friends, when i was a kid. I personally always loved to stay in my head, all the time. Albert Einstien, used to call these Thought Experiments. He even has been said, to invent an awful lot of theories, just in his head, before putting it on paper.</p>
<p>I am no Albert. But, just curious. Curious, that why my brain, just likes it own company. Curious, of why i derive happiness by making sense of <em>everything</em> around me, before i can get comfortable with it. But, i am not here, to tell you guys, about how my brain functions. This story is about, how the idea for Whurthay was born.</p>
<p>I was a real sad guy, during my college years, for the first two years. Like, many college students. I wasn’t very much interested, in what my school was teaching, and didn’t even knew, what i was doing with my life, or how collge would help.</p>
<p>But, I also had no other choice/way. As, i wasn’t good at anything else, and I wanted to be an engineer, and invent and build something as well.</p>
<p>So, i just carried on. But, one day, something strange happened. I stumbled upon the movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Social Network</a>. That movie showed me, how a guy from his dorm room, gets everything one desires from life, in a matter of months, if not days. What did he do? He built this cool website, The Facebook. and, he almost had everything come to him. He was just a nerd few months ago, and know body recognized him, like that after this piece of code, was made available to the public.</p>
<p>It was fascinating, shocking, all at the same time. I thought to myself, I like building things, and this is what i expected to do, when i joined an engineering college. When i read that Mark left Harvard, after the facebook, was popular. I quickly realised, that i need to do something apart of my college studies, to feel the love of the love of doing, what you love. </p>
<p>Yes, you are correct, I started learning PHP and MySQL and what not. Everything with which, the initial version of the Facebook was built. I even helped my sister, built her education company’s website, while still learning how to create a dropdown on the website frontend. </p>
<p>It all seamed crazy, but i loved it. I even got over, my fear, that nobody would visit my website, if i ever built one. When, people started to sign up, on my sister’s website. Few minutes, after it was launched.</p>
<p>It was all very exhilarating. </p>
<p>Now, i have come, a long way, after those early novice stages. But, i did had this inner self wanting to always know, who visited, what i have built. Whenever i built a website, it was always about, who was using it. As, it gave me this feeling of unending influence and love, when some real person, was experiencing what i had to offer(Always use Bot protection)</p>
<p>This was how Whurthay germinated. This is how it all started. Hope you guys, enjoy it as much, as i enjoyed building this web visitor tracking &amp; analytics platform. <a href="https://whurthay.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHURTHAY</a>. <a href="https://whurthay.com/#!/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free trial</a> </p>
