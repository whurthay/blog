While, web and mobile apps<br>usally run independent of the system on which they are used. Still, it is statistical to get to know the software and<br>hardware preferences of your customers. Like if you know your users are mostly on android or windows. Then, you could locate your target<br>niche with more ease now. As, everybody knows wars between segments of people using Android vs ios users and windows vs Mac users vs Linux users.</p><p>More linux users, mean you are really targeting the open source community, and more Mac users, you are targeting the market, with more<br>buying power. </p><p>Every little piece of information that you have about your customer is as powerful than anything, about getting to know them. It’s like<br>when you meet somebody for the first time. The more you know about them, even if it’s just about their favourite football team. You know<br>where to categorize them. It’s that simple</p><p>Hope you guys are enjoying whurthay as much as we love making and growing this.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/contents/new1.png" alt="Tag &amp; identify your visitors and get browser/device details"></p><p>We recently introduced a <code>tagging your visitor</code> feature. This would allow our present &amp; future customers to tag their visitors, while they are tracking their visits. This results in website owners/our customers to powerfully identify their visitors, with utmost ease. This is a powerful rollout, and we identify it as a game changer. This also separates us from other website tracking softwares, as this feature is one of its kind. Please review our provacy policy, to confirm, how we use this information. </p><p>We also included end users browser and device information. This means that our customers can now identify, the device and the browser with which their customers are visiting their site. This not only enables them to test their site with browsers from which there are the most frequent visits to their site, but also to develop different version of their sites for mobile and tablet, or easily make their current site responsive, if they have a huge chunk of traffic, visiting their site from mobile. Easy peasy.</p><p>Have any questions, shoot an email to <a href="mailto:katy@whurthay.com?subject=new features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy</a></p><p>Our pricing is pretty standard as well now, understanding the plethora of quality information our customers get from our site.

Why do hotels ask you to <code>check in</code> when you enter a hotel. Why do you need to put all that info, when they can see definitely judge by your appearance, that you are a nice young man/woman. Some might argue, that they don’t want a crooked man, to live at their place. But, Does storing their identiy really hinder crooken men from bypassing the system, once they know it. </p><p>Storing and tracking visitors to any place, is just what’s been happening from the beginning of time. It’s just been normal, until the internet came into existence. Like sometimes a person from a remote part of the world or a country can enter into and read all sensitive info from a company’s database. Taking no names here (Yahoo, Ebay etc), without them knowing it. Why is it that happens, and what can we do to stop it?</p><p>Simple, track your visitors, like a CCTV. Get their precise location, their referring sites, time and frequency of visit, everything stored at a finger length distance(use your keyboard). </p><p>and, Once you really need to identify, who was that person, at that time and that place, and visiting or bombarding bot style visit. You know, where to look, and who to contact.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Germination-of-the-Whurthay-movement"><a href="#Germination-of-the-Whurthay-movement" class="headerlink" title="Germination of the Whurthay movement"></a>Germination of the Whurthay movement</h2><p>Hi guys,<br>This is Ayush, the sole owner of the whurthay movement. Seems crazy, how is it a movement, when i am the only person in it?<br>Good question. But, to get to that, i would need to tell you a deep story about a quiet programmar. Programmars are of varied kinds as well. As, some of them program to build cool stuff and show it to the whole world. While, some just wants to live in their imagination. That’s just so much, more prettier.</p><p>I was the second kind. Never liked to go outside and play with my fellow friends, when i was a kid. I personally always loved to stay in my head, all the time. Albert Einstien, used to call these Thought Experiments. He even has been said, to invent an awful lot of theories, just in his head, before putting it on paper.</p><p>I am no Albert. But, just curious. Curious, that why my brain, just likes it own company. Curious, of why i derive happiness by making sense of <em>everything</em> around me, before i can get comfortable with it. But, i am not here, to tell you guys, about how my brain functions. This story is about, how the idea for Whurthay was born.</p><p>I was a real sad guy, during my college years, for the first two years. Like, many college students. I wasn’t very much interested, in what my school was teaching, and didn’t even knew, what i was doing with my life, or how collge would help.</p><p>But, I also had no other choice/way. As, i wasn’t good at anything else, and I wanted to be an engineer, and invent and build something as well.</p><p>So, i just carried on. But, one day, something strange happened. I stumbled upon the movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Social Network</a>. That movie showed me, how a guy from his dorm room, gets everything one desires from life, in a matter of months, if not days. What did he do? He built this cool website, The Facebook. and, he almost had everything come to him. He was just a nerd few months ago, and know body recognized him, like that after this piece of code, was made available to the public.</p><p>It was fascinating, shocking, all at the same time. I thought to myself, I like building things, and this is what i expected to do, when i joined an engineering college. When i read that Mark left Harvard, after the facebook, was popular. I quickly realised, that i need to do something apart of my college studies, to feel the love of the love of doing, what you love. </p><p>Yes, you are correct, I started learning PHP and MySQL and what not. Everything with which, the initial version of the Facebook was built. I even helped my sister, built her education company’s website, while still learning how to create a dropdown on the website frontend. </p><p>It all seamed crazy, but i loved it. I even got over, my fear, that nobody would visit my website, if i ever built one. When, people started to sign up, on my sister’s website. Few minutes, after it was launched.</p><p>It was all very exhilarating. </p><p>Now, i have come, a long way, after those early novice stages. But, i did had this inner self wanting to always know, who visited, what i have built. Whenever i built a website, it was always about, who was using it. As, it gave me this feeling of unending influence and love, when some real person, was experiencing what i had to offer(Always use Bot protection)</p><p>This was how Whurthay germinated. This is how it all started. Hope you guys, enjoy it as much, as i enjoyed building this web visitor tracking &amp; analytics platform. <a href="https://whurthay.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHURTHAY</a>. <a href="https://whurthay.com/#!/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free trial</a> </p>]]></content>
